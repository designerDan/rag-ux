pWhat does it take to be good at design If you follow the increasingly popularized design thinking model youll be led to conclude it takes empathy imagination experimentation curiosity and resilience While those are virtuous qualities to possess being good at design is much more simple than that Design is an act of creating futures How can that be simple The act of designing is not simple The list of what it takes to be good at it is You can distill design into exploration abduction and constriction You dont need empathy unless you are designing for someone other than yourself Exploration is what sets you on the path Good explorers enjoy seeing what can be seen As much as we work to improve the process and inputs of design the truth is that design just like everything else is an act of trial and error Exploration fuels the trials in spite of the errors Good design is seeing the possible you need an explorers spirit to do that From a practical standpoint exploration is generating a whole lot of tries First idea best idea is the sign of a poor designer Fifth idea pretty good idea is the sign of a good designer Abduction is a fancy word for sussing causes from the murk of consequences Good designers need to keep half a mind on the consequences of their choices This is the essence of design Realizing a future is coordinating consequences to produce an outcome Abduction is saying I did A and saw C B causes C Abduction is always a guess If you cant discover the cause of a consequence you cant plan around it The only way to get better at abduction is exploration Constriction is a really poor word but it ended in ion so Im going with it Constriction is setting up the bounds of the space The world may be your oyster but you cant design without some manner of limiting criteria Nature supplies you with one in the more of an aim objective goal purpose or desired outcome Being good at design is creating a tighter boundary than a goal SMART goals may work but arent quite the direction to go Think of constriction less of Im hungry and want a hamburger and more of Im hungry and want a buffalo burger on wheat with organic tomatoes arugula and dijon mustard The boundaries are more tightly defined so now you can go about creating that burger The design is in the constriction not the creation Good designers are specific Any discussion about literacy and design can be considered splitting hairs The beauty of concepts is that they are so fuzzy Exploration is imagination experimentation curiosity and resilience Abduction is experimentation Constriction is a terrible word shame on me but the idea of defining a space is central to design Understand these ideas and youll be good at design emSVA

mainframes contain 80 of the worlds business data AI is probabilistic and traditional computing is deterministic Deterministic is prescriptive and predictable If the user does this then this happen Because the data changes over time the AIs output will change over time Affordances amp Signifiers are still true to AI design Making the AI evident in the experience builds trust Youre about to interact with an AI Continue Track the decisions AI has made in your software You might denote that this stock has performed well and the AI making a prediction it will continue to perform well otherwise you customers will lose track of what is true and what is fiction what is real and what is a guess The ideal UX for AI ensures the human has control and maintains the final decision Would you like for our system to purchase the stock for you A good UX for AI includes implicit explicit or dual feedback loops Can use surveys comments as feedback mechanisms to improve You can track how many back and forths were exchanged before the user got the answer they wanted as a quality metric Did this answer you question is only half the story what the experience was like getting to the

Prompt tuning and finetuning are how you keep responses relevant to your customers and keep them speaking in their language Jocelyne Light 149 PM I worked on project with a devdata scientist where we used AI to pull topics out of 1500 podcast episodes AI still needs the instruction and quality controls to corale its output Because so much thinking is about problem solving we believe that more information will reveal the cause and allow us to remove it thereby solving the problem Were operating in a deductive manner smattered with induction We play at Sherlock Holmes thinking if only I knew more then the solution would be revealed Information is good for mapping context but does little to help you move forward After all you cant know about the future until it happens Hunting for more

disagreement For reasons beyond my comprehension the fight or flight response is triggered by a disagreement I think that a lot of energy is required to remake thoughts The brain is inherently lazy The brain protects the energy resource it has by triggering emotions of combat or retreat Thoughts are not a physical threat but we feel them as such Dealing with disagreement is the act of making space inside your mind for a conflicting perspective Dealing with disagreement is not the same as arguing well Shouting matches are not dealing with disagreement Dealing with disagreement is not the same as someone who doesnt back down from conflict Bullies dont deal with disagreement Dealing with disagreement is not the same as debate though the decorum may look similar Debate is an academic practice for intellectuals Disagreement happens between all people and rarely carries a formal structure Making space inside your mind is surprisingly easy We do it all the time when we like someone we meet We make concession for our friends at an alarming rate There is a danger here friend or enemy are not useful constructs when dealing with disagreement You wont be successful trying to see

split up the dataset randomly into 80 train set 10 dev set 10 test set Train the bigram and trigram models only on the training set Evaluate them on dev and test splits What can you see E03 use the dev set to tune the strength of smoothing or regularization for the trigram model  ie try many possibilities and see which one works best based on the dev set loss What patterns can you see in the train and dev set loss as you tune this strength Take the best setting of the smoothing and evaluate on the test set once and at the end How good of a loss do you achieve E04 we saw that our 1hot vectors merely select a row of W so producing these vectors explicitly feels wasteful Can you delete our use of Foneemhot in favor of simply indexing into rows of W E05 look up and use Fcrossementropy

inevitable Immortality is a curse The end is part of the design yet it is rarely considered Theres also a tremendous negative value to the idea of the end Fear dictates that we keep what we have

repurchase This is called designed obsolescence and it has virtue thought not always What I mean here by designing ruin is a similar practice The near term is only one of many timeframes to design for

sense the entirety of design exists to satisfy our own and other peoples values In fact itd be difficult to argue against the idea that all action all motion all human effort exists to satisfy our own

worth being reminded of at points Its possible the manner in which design satisfies our values is novel to design If you find yourself looking at the biggest picture you might see that everything is

frightened state need to be considered in isolation Lets be pedantic about it The behavior is not irrational but contextually rational to a frightened state Greed is the growth side of fear Fear is loss Greed is gain Fear drives when it wants Greed takes over inbetween Greed has a strong negative stigma in many religiousbased modern cultures Greed begins as a selfish desire Much in the way that fear of individual loss is felt greater than fear of collective loss so too does greed concern itself to the individual before the collective Greed can be pointed at a gain for many Laziness as a motivator is tied to the conservation of life on the anatomical level Life energy is abundant but finite We all die Living bodies have inherited an understanding of this fact over the course of

being equal alternatives requiring the least effort are the ones we choose Desiring not to extend unnecessary effort is not a character flaw it is instead a virtue of smart people Purposes motivate people Purposes are an inner state linked to an outer goal Inner states are drive Outer results are goals Emotions are neural memories of body states Desire to change our inner states produces an inner vision of outer results The value in that combination gives purpose and once purpose is attained the body acts The plan is set execute Purposes can be conflicting false and redefined Action doesnt guarantee results Try and err The drive continues until the purpose is dissolved or the drive is overcome by another more urgent drive Fear greed and laziness motivate a change of inner state

The idea of current users and future users has value Obviously Everything benefits from being designed Well everything that has been designed benefits the people and situations for which it was designed What was excluded from consideration may gain benefit from design or it may not System stress is certainly something we cannot let happen by accident All systems contain stress points These occur only within the confines of the system Systems are isolated ecologies Any stress will result from the design intentionally or not Since stress will happen its better for designers to work with it up front If you wait to deal with stress when it emerges you may have to make drastic changes to your design to accommodate the effects of the stress An example however basic and archaic is a keystone in an arch Physics prevents us from creating an arch without some manner of keystone even a conceptual one The arch contains stress from gravity The keystone distributes that stress Buckminster Fuller created a geodesic dome based on the principles of stress distributions He designed a system that understood how to handle the stress it would encounter and generate He intentionally designed or discovered the stress points of the geodesic dome system Consider the systems youve built for yourself Perhaps you have a routine youve designed If youve ever encounter a moment where its burdensome to complete your routine then youve encountered system stress Perhaps you adapted your routine accordingly Maybe you pulled some elements out rearranged others or abandoned your routine entirely If you have then youre designing I postulate you would receive more benefit from your routine if you had accommodated for the stresses earlier in your design process Perhaps you couldnt because attention is limited and humans cant consider the infinite factors which contribute to the current moment Thats fine but now you know and you can use that knowledge going forward Give

humanitys ability to project Its a meta act similar to orchestration What design allows us to do is be proactive We know humans continually seek to change their state and status Design is what allows us to do that Well design is the name weve attached to the activity The way of the universe is what allows us to do that Your actions are what produce outcomes Design guides your actions Design puts elements together When they line up in our mind we execute You can design on the fly In some sense design is always momentary The more traditional view of design is as a precursor completed before action is taken Insecurities drive the traditional view We refuse to handle chaos Were biologically built to create meaning from chaos but that act is energy intensive so we avoid it We avoid paying attention to the thought Were always creating meaning from chaos We cant avoid it but we can refuse to consciously acknowledge that fact With design were continually imagining the outcomes of our actions How do the actions build on each other I do this then this will happen and because this happened then I do this Or you can come at it backwards I need this to happen so I will do this which needs this to happen so I will do this Youre tracing a path through anticipated consequences to realize the change you seek You can consider design as forethought but its not just thinking about the chain of causation it is actively manipulating the elements until the end of the chain gets you what you want Design is uncomfortably human but that means everyone does it Every person seeks change

interfaces One of the largest challenges any particular person will face is guiding yourself to do something new It may be more like the challenge is less about doing something new and more about stopping what youre currently doing In either case the end result is the same Youre wanting to form new neural pathways in your brain Thats really what behaviors are A vital point about changing behavior is that you dont lose the old the behavior It may go away but neural pathways persist far longer than you might think Changing an existing behavior is the processes of rerouting electrical activity so that it doesnt follow the existing pathway but is diverted to the new one instead Diverting your neural activity needs to happen repeatedly so that it ultimately takes less energy that the old pathways Behavior change happens in small moments over time An easy way to divert your neural activity is to set up an interruption A common example is freezing a credit card in a block of ice to prevent expenditure Though thats not the most beneficial behavior these days since online shopping only requires numbers and ice is transparent But anyways Interruptions force attention They create decision points Do this or do that You cant be lazy and expect to change how you want Your nature requires a different approach Its uncomfortable sure but not impossible Put yourself in your own way

we dont make sense of the ends we make sense of the space in between Humans experience the world as a relationship between themselves and the environment Conceptually these can be redefined I can think of myself as a hero and the environment as unchanging or I can think of myself as a villain and the environment as my clay The endpoints dont determine the relationships available but they do prime the pump for certain relationships to be more obtuse What am I to this table Its a ridiculous question but it forms the basis for our interactions with it We create meaning from our answer If I am taller than the table I might see this table as a step to a high location If I am shorter I might see this table as an immovable mountain Youre not redefining what the table is but what it is in relation to what you are By all means change the endpoints There is infinite variety in that Consider though that the endpoints are less meaningful than the relation between them because the relation is what we create The relation is often the more subjective factor You might not find anything when you do change the relation but know that it is within your control Its about the only thing within

create guilt Im merely pointing out that in its negativity guilt is highly constructive Cultures are defined as much if not more by what they place negative value on than by what they place positive value on It is possible that we limit ourselves by feeling guilty over actions that we need not feel guilty over Therein lies the tricky bit We need guilt to control our actions but that control

uncommon knowledge that our individual experiences of the world are highly biased With our brains acting as selforganizing information systems it cannot be any other way One such bias worthy of consideration is known as deformation professionelle which is the tendency to view the world through the distorting lens of your job or training This shares commonality with the colloquialism that if all you have is a hammer then everything looks like a nail Deformation professionelle can be particularly insidious in the realm of design because design is of such a high order thinking skill meaning design deals primarily with very fuzzy abstractions Designers are taught that design is a means to accomplish a goal Name a situation where a means to accomplish a goal is not applicable and youll see the point Im making We need more design We need better design Design can help here are all traps of deformation professionelle It is possible those statements ring true more often than not but nothing

UX via the Copilot stack An incredibly important point to note about any creative endeavor is that the context it will live in is not the same as the context it was created in This means unless you consider the differences in the contexts then your designs will be insufficient Context changes at the drop of a note It is nearly impossible to predict or create a context and your predictions will rarely be spot on In the same way that planning is more important than the plan the act of considering the difference in contexts is more important than getting the context right A crucial reason for considering contexts is the design of outcomes We want our designs to catalyze a change for our audience Every context requires a different approach to create a change The types of variables which constitute our reality are so noisy that what worked yesterday when the sun was low might not work a month from now when the sun is high Our designs either need to be bespoke enough to guarantee success in this moment or general enough to work in other moments The balance is delicate and excruciating if not impossible to nail Once again the act is more important than the result No context contains the possibility of every outcome which is precisely why you need to know what outcome you are designing for and which contexts are primed to realize those outcomes Anything else is painting a target around your shots emSVA Because you cannot control the speed of the AI due to mathematical constrictions physical limitations and power trafficking you have to make things that are slow feel

is generally known as steps but Im not sure ai It is possible to change your perception In that aspect our brains are wonderfully malleable sacks of water While this change may be seemingly impossible with a basic understanding of the element which shape what we see it will be easier The first element is context In this case context means everything your brain has processed since the first neural connection was made Thats a lot of processing Most of the processing has been done without a conscious awareness All that means is your history has primed you to accept certain perceptions more easily than others Once bitten twice shy is an example of context in action You cant go back and redo what has already been done but you can remember the past differently History is written into the wiring of your brain which as noted before is highly malleable Rewrite your history Remember events and change the narrative in your head about the event Context is a bit tricky in that it is shaped by cultural and individual differences Your life is your life Everything that happened to you is unique to you but youve existed inside an environment that we often refer to as culture Culture is a collective context Its the social history shared beliefs laws norms rights and roles of the people surrounding you Culture can be minute or massive Culture changes over time One quick way to shift your worldview is to jump cultures Thats not an invitation to change the culture around you Thats an invitation to leave your current culture for a new one Move A second element shaping what you see is experience Context contains and influences experience Experience is the thread of meaningful moments that have led you to where you are Context is subtle Experience is not That time that one day you felt pure joy is an experience That time that other day you felt trepidation is an other experience Experience is unique in that it is a full body thing Experience lives not only in your mind but in your emotions and in your muscles Tension is experience Trauma is experience Nostalgia is experience Experiences need to be confronted to be changed Once again you cant go back and redo what youve experienced but you can reinterpret and understand your experiences in a different way If you can integrate the tension and trauma back into your self you release it You allow the experience to let go of its hold on you Once bitten twice shy becomes once bitten The final element is likely the headiest of them all and that is schemata Schemata are mental architectures If all you have known are horses and you see a zebra you will think it an oddly colored horse Which is not entirely untrue just not nuanced Perhaps a better example is the common banana If all you have known are grocery store yellow bananas and you come across a plantain you might be tempted to treat it like a yellow banana A more nefarious schemata exists around human differences If all you have known are melatonin deprived humans when you encounter a melatonin rich human you may be tempted to treat that person as less than Schemata are organized patterns of thought or behavior They are the boxes with labels that you place things in They are built up through experience in context As such schemata are the easiest to change but the least influential Opening yourself up to being wrong about what you see starts the schemata change Knowledge can change schemata But really change the label and you change the schemata Switch bad to good gross to unexplained harmful to misunderstood empty to anticipatory

constrict You have two cameras one to see the scene and the other to track the eye Apple Vision Pro has 4 IR cameras and 12 cameras overall 13 of the cameras are dedicated to eye tracking 2 IR cameras per eye for 4 total Getting ground truth is matching the environment to the gaze this can be done by asking to stare at a target or double clicking on a button because you look at a button before clicking on it Dark pupil and bright pupil are two ways to to determine pupils Pupil detection has shifted from edge detection to deep learning neural networks like NVGaze and CNNs Use a beam splitter which is a halfsilver mirror to allow the camera to see the eye front on without the camera The FOVEA and not the optical axis determines the gaze The optical axis is the pole that run through the center of the eye The FOVEA is offset from the center by a number of degrees which varies per person This degree difference between the optical axis and visual axis is called the kappa angle Because of the kappa angle devices need user specific calibration like look around the screen at these dots Pupil center corneal reflection PCCR can determine the center of the pupil but you can use more eye features like iris location and eye contour in addition to corneal reflection and pupil There are a lot of synthetic datasets for eye tracking training Many are from the 2010s These can be used to

inductive reasoning in machine learning It works from distributed representation Perceptrons do not account for interdependent relationships between attributes and as such are deficient The four ways of machine learning are supervised unsupervised semisupervised and reinforcement learning Supervised learning takes inputs and their corresponding outputs and induces the rules that govern the system They are supervised in that the proof is given the system substantiates the evidence Supervised learning best addresses classification and regression problems Unsupervised learning takes data and finds patterns generally too complex for humans to discover on their own This style of learning can produce generative models which can make from the patterns they learn Semisupervised learning uses the patterning of unsupervised learning to improve supervised learning Data is distilled and cleaned through the unsupervised learning before being passed to the supervised system This approach is beneficial if only a small portion of the training examples have been associated with a known output Reinforcement learning is not trained on existing data but learns from the feedback regarding the consequences of its actions This is useful when reward is the point like in a game or when success conditions are vague Hierarchical feature learning object recognition 20 questions is a learning

teams is a complex process with a multitude of considerations to keep in mind From the size of the team to the different types of decision makers designing for teams requires a nuanced approach But one of the most crucial aspects of designing for teams is considering user roles permissions and account administration When do these considerations come into play According to a collaborative tool designer its important to start thinking about them as soon as something becomes collaborative and theres a concept of multiple people being able to access something Even if the number of roles or permissions isnt that complex at first its essential to create a simple scalable model from the getgo If the early model doesnt scale well it can become a technical and UX burden that the team will have to live with for years to come So how can you create a solid foundation for user roles permissions and account administration Start by looking at other tools such as Google Docs or Dropbox and see how they handle permissions and roles Build a table or matrix of their permissions and roles and see how they work for your own product Then decide where you want to deviate or stick with established models Its important to note that different teams have different needs when it comes to user roles and permissions For example a 10person team may be more concerned with individual employees who have a say in which tools they use while a 1000person team may be more concerned with decision makers higher up in the organization Designers need to take these nuances into account when creating user roles and permissions Another important consideration is how user roles and permissions affect collaboration Collaborative tools should make it easy for team members to work together seamlessly regardless of their roles and permissions This means that designers need to think about how user roles and permissions affect workflows and processes and create a system that facilitates collaboration rather than hindering it Finally its important to create a system that is flexible and adaptable As teams grow and evolve their needs for user roles and permissions may change Designers need to create a system that can accommodate these changes without causing disruption or confusion Designing for teams is a complex process but by considering user roles permissions and account administration from the outset designers can create a system that fosters collaboration facilitates workflows and adapts to the changing needs of teams over time emSVA design

foundation Weve called it truth Trust is an expression of truth With few exceptions humans only trust what we believe to be true Our challenge to creating trust then is knowing what others need to believe to be true If youre a person trying to gain the trust of another the prevailing theory is that all you need is to convince the other that you will not harm them Said another way you will not take anything from them namely their physical safety and more abstractly their sovereignity If youre designing something which needs to gain the trust of your audience the challenge can seem

competes with existing solutions can be a daunting task On one hand you want to offer new and innovative features that differentiate your product from competitors but on the other hand you also need to provide important feature parity that meets the basic needs of your users In this article well explore how to balance innovation and necessity when designing for feature parity First and foremost its important to understand that users are unlikely to switch to a new tool unless their existing tool is either incredibly painful to use or the new tool is significantly better Therefore its critical to offer enough functionality that users can reasonably use the new tool for simple versions of core use cases even if its initially more challenging to use However you also need to include features that make your product feel differentiated and appealing especially at launch When launching FigJam for example the team actively traded off core functionality like a timer or voting which other tools had in order to build features that they didnt They quickly followed up with those tools to create feature parity but their initial focus was on providing unique features that would attract users For example FigJam offers cursor chat and highfiving which are not available in other collaborative design tools Its also important to show momentum in building new features As a new tool you want users to trust that you will eventually get to feature parity even if youre not there yet Therefore its critical to have a roadmap that shows users what features are coming in the future and how they will benefit them Ultimately the key to designing for feature parity is to strike a balance between innovation and necessity You need to provide enough functionality to meet users basic needs while also offering unique features that make your product stand out By doing so you can create a product that attracts users and keeps them coming back for more emSVA ux ai

instance refers to a mental time jump into the future As a species at some point we started to become aware of the idea of consequences that you can thread your current actions with a future result This is a highly useful realization It is not without fault Many enlightened minds will tell you the future doesnt exist Regardless we have come to understand we can control the world around us to create specific outcomes We could not do this without an understanding of consequences We could not get better at it without projection At all points we carry with us an aim something were trying to accomplish We work to change what we can in order to see that aim fulfilled Projection helps us determine how to bridge the space between now and what we want to be different We project because the variables are too complex to manipulate in the moment No brain can correctly navigate the now without preparation It is why we have an aim A guiding light The simple truth is that as immense as our

intent is to expose what is important about AI image generation to an audience that wants to know both how it works and how to work with it This technology is multifaceted and I cover a lot of ground Im curious and I seek the answers to the questions how does this work and can it do this This Meetup is me sharing my path and findings Ill be running this in a chatonly lecture format Ill provide interactions Ill be off camera and sharing my screen WHERE THIS IS GOING By the end of what Im doing here actually well hopefully way before the end of what Im doing here but certainly before the end of your involvement with what Im doing here I aim to expose you to the current patterns and functional foundations of AI image generation software Im going to show you how you to design for these softwares The goal is to give you the knowledge and tools to build up a skill in creating experiences for and with AI image generators Agenda Patterns of UX in AI image generators Challenges of UX for AI image generation Heuristics to address the challenges of UX for AI image generation Smash class on UX Code  Tools Putting it together  Using AI for UX PATTERNS In this section you will get insight into the interface interactive and functional patterns many of the AI image generation softwares have in common Were going to levelset awareness and establish a shared context Were going to look for common layouts interactions as well as patterns in task flows error recovery and overall experiences Our goal is 15 to analyze 15 You test with 15 people and you get at least a sigma of security Or so Im induced to believe Where to find these softwares The search term returning the most general results right now is AI image generation  Google  Perplexity if you prefer  Product Hunt

to maintain a constant awareness of what everyone else is doing Maintain a curiosity in the idea and youll find your sources of information Committing to quarterly reviews may be enough to maintain your list Consider the black swans as best you can Lets check in on a few companies in the space Question to the audience what image generation software have you heard of or worked with or are excited about Daniels Pix Microsoft Designer httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvCiuBCIBABo  What I dig about this is the interface It is context aware and places the actions close to that which is acted upon rather than using a fixed menu where the actions are far removed from the object  It is solid interaction design with good functionality for free Adobe Express is a direct parallel as are other tools Learning Playground httpswwwyoutubecomplaygroundaivideos  This guy is super cool He teaches you about the software In the process he shows you how the technology all these other softwares use works Great place to go to learn Great software to work in It costs your data but you get 1000 generations a day and you get to play with stable diffusion Learning Visual Electric httpswwwyoutubecomvisualelectric  what Visual Electric is selling are their models which they occupy as styles  They are winning with their eye They are curated and artistic For sure a model to back Facet httpswwwyoutubecomfacetemai  image generator combined with photo manipulations mostly levels and saturations and overlays and stuff  Facet is great for photo editors and photographers It is a low level but streamlined Photoshop and an AI backed Mac PhotoStudio  Facet is selling tools and a workflow Krea httpswwwkreaaihome  from httpswwwartbreedercom which is the earliest and best example outside of academia for these softwares today  Im likely wrong about this  Krea is different Krea is not selling a model they are selling functionality and they are straight winning on all fronts From my perspective they are the people to beat and bet on Makereal httpsmakerealtldrawcom  great interface  cutting edge of this idea  publicly available github 1000 to the open source

LAIONArt httpslabelboxcomdatasetslaionart Civit httpscivitaicommodels LoRA httpsarxivorgabs210609685 Insights In this section you got a broad spectrum view of the interface interactive and functional patterns of the many AI image generation softwares out there and you realized they all have more in common than dont The insight is that there is a technology that powers all of this and when you discover the patterns you discover its capabilities and you start to see the human intervention on the benefit of a consumer SECTION 2  CHALLENGES Lets talk about the challenges UX faces Microsoft has pulled together their guide called the HAX IBM has a guide for AI Google Design on the UX of AI UX of AI website on AI Refire Designs take on UX and AI Kirill Lazarev on UX best practices for crafting AI excellence John Maedas UX patterns for copilot Adam Fard with a new way of designing AI amp UX with Hang Xu amp Peter Gostev UX and AI with Intelligence Briefing The Shape of AI in review Vitaly Friedmans take on UX and AI Ericsson has a guide to UX and AI Machine learning for designers Canvas take on UX for AI UX challenges from that one Meetup 5 gotchas in AI Perplexity tells me the main challenges with UX for AI image generation Heres my hot take on the challenges relevant to UX for AI image generation Were going to start where it doesnt matter and end where it does The ne plus ultra The main challenge of AI is how to translate subjective human needs values and experiences into algorithmic parameters the model can optimize for Other challenges are to keep the data appropriate to your audience act ethical and take accountability for the impact of AI as a whole These are lofty challenges like trust ethics and value Thats not what Im about Those challenges exist and are addressed but are too broad for this audience This is akin to saying UX is going to change the world And it will right after rock and roll does 6 challenges specific to user experience in particular in my words  indicating what the AI can do  installing ownership provenance and authenticity of training data routines  designing interactions for nondeterministic outcomes  providing feedback loops to improve the AI  managing user expectations about what the AI can do  keeping the user in control In this section we took a wide view of the challenges the experts say the field of UX for AI image generation faces Where I lacked evidence for the specific you were presented with the generic challenges of UX for AI From this evidence you were given 6 challenges specific to UX for AI image generation SECTION 3  HEURISTICS Microsoft has pulled together their guide called the HAX IBM has a guide for AI Google Design on the UX of AI UX of AI website on AI Refire Designs take on UX and AI

Meetup 5 gotchas in AI Perplexity tells me the main challenges with UX for AI image generation Check this video out for more UX amp AI at Microsoft In this section youll be presented with a set of beneficial heuristics for addressing the 6 challenges above Perplexity addresses the heuristic themes in three pairs Trust amp transparency Feedback amp control Ethical amp humancentered I agree and consider that a useful framework Here is my summation Challenge indicating what the AI can do You can generate buttons based on the most common prompts You seem to do this a lot lt This is the ML part the predictive part Would you like to automate it This leads to the UX patterns of hey this thing is an AI here are some suggested actions and give us your feedback Challenge installing routines for ownership provenance and authenticity of training data You need to show your references cite your sources Dont collect what you dont need use ondevice ML instead Find a way to attach licenses of use or other provenance data to your images both training and generated but especially your training data Challenge designing interactions for nondeterministic outcomes Text prompts are not a good UI tool Clearly communicate permissions settings recovery plans in case of errors and provide a way forward based on the severity of possible outcomes Challenge providing feedback loops to improve the AI Culture isnt static therefore the research cannot be static Design for the labelers Use user input to improve AI over time via feedback loops like answer ratings or Roman voting Challenge managing user expectations about what the AI can do If a human cant perform the task neither can an AI Communicate confidence with multiple options ordered by rank Make waiting fun is a core UX for AI principle Challenge keeping the user in control Allow people to turn the AI off Give the human the ability to override the AIs decisions at any point AI heres what Im going to do are you good with this HEURISTIC PILLARS This leads to the UX patterns of hey this thing is an AI here are some suggested actions and give us your feedback Find a way to attach licenses of use or other provenance data to your images both training and generated but especially your training data Culture isnt static therefore the research cannot be static If a human cant perform the task neither can an AI Make waiting fun is a core UX for AI principle Allow people to turn the AI off Nobody has UX for AI figured out Jakob Nielsen of whatever fame and clout you give him wonders who will be the Jakob Nielsen for the AI generation He points us to the fact that their arent established heuristics for this technology Make sure you acknowledge and respect old knowledge but feel free to disregard all of it and use exploration and practice as your tools for learning Now that we have addressed our challenges and heuristics we can summarize it in DANIELS UX for AI Definition of done No AI can be released until it  indicates to the user what the AI can do  has routines for ownership provenance and authenticity of training data  accounts for nondeterministic outcomes  has beneficial feedback loops  manages user expectations about what the AI can do  keeps the user in control From here on our focus will shift to how we work with the AI image generation software and design for it But first a beneficial deviation in the form of a SMASH CLASS IN UX This is not an aside this is a smash class in neuroscience ecological psychology gestalt perception and humanfactors engineering Consider this a refresher if youre through and done with all the brain stuff in design Neuroscience Ecological psychology httpsyoutubek4fKBquRis Gestalt Visual illusion museum teaches gestalt on some level These visual puzzles

awareness of what AI image generation software can do and weve seen the current experience trends and patterns weve surmised the challenges and heuristics from expert witnesses weve gotten a smash class in UX weve seen the code weve been introduced to the platforms Weve covered AI powered tools for UX design Now it is time to put all this nonsense into practice Lets build Good UX begins with the user heres a discussion to define them Beneficial curiosities for the field of UX and AI Good research questions to improve an AI Indulge me in another diatribe this one on personas You can call them users personas archetypes audience members cast and crew You can call them whatever They are the people who exist and are human interacting with what you are making It is generally considered a benefit to know who these people are and what they care about Call that understanding whatever you want What is important is that you and your compatriots possess and agree on a physical emotional and mental knowledge of the people you hope you benefit Otherwise you are designing for yourself and your myopia cant sustain your efforts Give me places to find people who are into x Who are the users and what are they using it for Who woke up this morning wanting to pay money for AI image generation put some users and use cases in the chat help people get an idea of what AI image generation is good for This question in particular is what these businesses are in a mad scramble to figure out I know creative agencies are trying to figure out how to leverage it for concept and pitch work I saw a guy work to make movies and commercials with it Marketing is big into AI image generation for product photography Fashion is into AI image generation for ideas and concept visualization Canva is trying to keep AI inhouse for creating social graphics and banners and the what not they call it visual communication MidJourney gives you dope images but like what value does it have for your mom or the cab driver or the CEO of Salesforce or your little cousin These are the questions that will determine your UX I personally see these tools as democratizing visual talent so I think they will find their value in social media creation though they will most likely just be ubiquitous in any software turn your quarterly report into a captivating 4 minute video or turn your Notion database into an epic movie kinda thing Ill create a persona based on that Using AI for UX Ask perplexity to create a persona You can get personas httpsuserpersonadev httpsaiboardofinnovationcompersonasmaker Lets talk product ideas put a paid link in the chat Turn this comment into an action movie Turn this comment into a comedy staring Will Ferrell Turn this comment into a hardboiled detective film In this section we learned about the users and use cases We crafted a persona with a value proposition with a goal and with a scenario SECTION 5 As a designer if you want to go beyond being a user of these tools to a designer of these tools then you wont get there by using them httpscoursefastaiLessonspart2html httpsml5jsorg AI image generators explained Artistic control is still missing from generative visual AI for it to usurp traditional methods To current what youve been shown are closed environments paywalled ventures moneybacked guarantees You cant get in hack them about and build for them unless you are invited to You can thread the softwares together in a narrative fashion but you cant alter them None of that is true for Stable Diffusion Stable Diffusion is open source A webUI has been provided for branching and download on Github This webUI gives you access to the functionality with minor competitive exceptions of at least 80 and at most 96 of all AI image generator softwares What were going to do is install the Stable Diffusion webUI so we can handson design our own AI image generation experience httpsdocspinokiocomputerdownload The generosity of the open source community and their impact on learning is near unparalleled Maybe long ago or at this point you disconnected You work mostly in Figma You dont do code so this is too much and not applicable Youre not wrong If you want to design take and remix some of these softwares inside Figma you can do so You can make prototypes you can do flows research mockups the works Thats what youll be doing when you get employed Maybe thats what youre already doing What you gain this way are access to the results Designing in Figma is designing a dream All the mockups are imagined until they can be made real proven they cannot be made real or abandoned as an effort Figma cant return the results of a model Yet I guess Because of this you dont consider as well the feasibility of your design Im all for dreaming and vision setting work but I find the pragmatic perspective the one that works with feasible is where the money is made If your design is not released because it isnt feasible then it is not valuable to the same degree as a design that is released Another benefit of going through this code is a full exposure to the raw tools This interface has been designed but not by a designer Youre seeing a baser state The machinations of the experience The exposed functions of working with a model This perspective of seeing the raw materials is a better place for learning and growth than the other softwares where a lot of what you need to learn has already been figured out and made rigid Im not saying abandon Figma Im a UX designer Im not going to not use Figma but were going to bring it in at a different point Now for Stable Diffusion What Im so enamored of about the webUI is that it looks like something youd get from a developer Super rich and performant and structured but theres like a finesse thats missing one that UX can create This seems like the front save for working in the model Using the IDEO vernacular this is what you have to make desirable This is what you have to bring the user to This is the point of capacity barring inventive deviations and as yet unknown personal revelations Code The only code you need to know is copy and paste CTRL  V If youre stubborn driven or a savant you could learn brew cmake protobuf rust python git and wget Make sure you have a GitHub account Making sure you are starting from a good base What old and unnecessary software to remove for a fresh beginning and how to remove it We will go through that process  To install StableDiffusion WebUI locally you need to look for AUTOMATIC1111 We will start with Stable Diffusion 15 It is pretty not that great of a model It is earlier stage but performant and tuned Im not much of a car person but an apt metaphor occurs to me That of the Toyota Supras infamous engine It is bulletproof That engine has been tuned and refined as to thrive no matter what you throw at it My understanding is that Stable Diffusion 15 is comparative A highly tuned performant machine Youre not wrong to change models but if something starts behaving unexpectedly move back to the 15 model and see if you dont get the results you expected Download the recommended from AUTOMATIC1111 plus these You may get stuck at this point due to the downloads If youve got any going and its wrecking your speed then cancel them Theres a list in the invite  I want to do this realtime but this part is the worst Understand there is a certain amount of set it and forget it and you get to carry your models around so you only have to set it up once per model locally It is an unfortunate result of large file sizes What is pruned and emaonly

they are trying to generate Its generally not what they write as prompts but the deeper emotional desire When I can have this amazing ability to write blogs create images do all the things generative AI promises with no inherent talent in any of them Im seeking something at the top Generative AI is scary complex and new The technology hasnt been socialized yet Questions regarding social issues like authenticity are what drive the field Creatives train to have a style then somebody decides to use their work in an AI model and suddenly the creatives style is available to all This biases datasets and negatively impacts a creatives livelihood We havent figured out how generative AI integrates into the lives of artists it questions core arguments about ownership and compensation Loose systems encourage appropriation or at least allow for it Is that it is necessary As an action design is intentional Every action by a human is intentional Action cannot be any other way As a noun there is nothing about design which must be intentional An object be it physical metaphysical experiential temporal or otherwise can possess a design devoid of intent Evolution is a viable mechanism for design The evolution of the natural world is always in response to the moment There is no future for a tree There is no future for DNA RNA or any other perceived architecture of the natural world Order has emerged from chaos The universe and all things in it are the way they are because they are they way they are Their design has no intention It is human nature to impose a design upon our surroundings We must create an order to navigate our reality Yet spontaneous order can occur subsist and thrive It could be argued that this type of order is the most stable of all orders because it was born purely from circumstance The best example to illustrate this point might be the bead spinner httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvIFirAohem1xY In no case is design necessary Yet unless you prefer chance to dedicated effort it is often the best path forward emSVA Syntax Runtime and Semantic error are three common errors Look up errors you dont understand on StackOverflow Semantic errors are unexpected outputs For interviewing to be fair and effective it needs to tolerate culture discomfort and biases Basically everything is culture Culture impacts what you dont see about someone Your tendency unchecked is to project your own selfworth onto another With this myopic perspective youll find it difficult to see the values in experiences outside your own What would this persons culture value is a backpocket question for you to understand projecting yourself onto others Instead ask your conversation partner about their learnings and ways they see those learnings being effective in this

be myopic when designing for a living We get caught up in the goals set for us We focus on our minimum viable audience We make decisions based on customer satisfaction corporate returns and retention rates Which are all important and keep the design industry thriving Thats not all there is to design What you set your sights on is what you achieve Humans are amazing in that regard If youre so focused on the small piece in front of you the bigger piece around you gets ignored Even more insidious is being blind to the impact the small piece has on the big piece and vice versa It is beyond the ability of any human entity to solve the biggest problems of our day There will always be war famine starvation the haves and the have nots What we can do is design for the link between the small and big Break free from designing in isolation and start seeing how you can create abundance for everyone Create twice as much as anticipated so theres enough to spread around emSVA ux ai Consider

httpsaigoogledev httpsplatformstabilityai httpswebappengineeringlumalabscomapiv1alphageniedocs In the beginning was the Word The mechanism by which all things were brought into being The dream of man to possess the Word is the primordial dream Yet until now we have not so closely realized that dream Think about it Sora while a simulated world and in no sense comparable to the world of the Word is yet still a world into which we will speak and it will change in accord The Word was made flesh as only the Word can but now our words will contain in worlds and echoes indistinguishable from our own their own preeminence The significance is not religious Only a few know the Word and its connection The significance is of human nature Our dream to posses the Word is protozoic it needs no label no language no vision to be understood Theres a duality in everything but unity I imagine the dark side to this reality is corruption of the ego and disassociation Speak and it shall be so is a powerful and heavy proposition Once obtained living in a world devoid of it the world of the Word loses flavor You may see this as pessimistic Though I do concern myself with not the things of man I am excited by the potential of Sora and wish I had a better way to end this narrative You have designed your next steps since you the moment you awoke to the world All of the next steps which dont come prepackaged at least Through testing and feedback trial and error youve learned the actions and the order of achievement Many of those actions were constructed as hypotheses and tested against Have you achieved what you set out to achieve Yes WOOT No Woot This is designing We need to acknowledge that an element of predisposition exists in our structural makeup We need to acknowledge that certain people are more likely to do certain things We form clubs of commonality and call them communities based around our predispositions It follows then that certain people are likely to design actions in line with their predispositions Each of us has an inclination for how to approach a situation emSVA httpsgithubcomAUTOMATIC1111stablediffusionwebui stablediffusion ux ai httpsdesignhumandatanet Data privacy As a designer I have spent the better part of my career championing the idea that the interface is the system This principle holds true across a wide range of design disciplines from software and hardware to digital and physical products Essentially the interface is the point of interaction between the user and the system and as such it plays a critical role in shaping the user experience The interface is more than just a surfacelevel design element It is the embodiment of the underlying systems functionality and it is where the users mental model of the system is formed If the interface is poorly designed the users mental model will be flawed leading to frustration confusion and ultimately a poor user experience Therefore its essential for designers to approach interface design with the same level of care and attention as they would any other aspect of the system Its not enough to simply make the interface look good it must also be designed to be functional intuitive and userfriendly One of the key principles of good interface design is simplicity The interface should be designed to be easy to understand and use with a minimal learning curve This means minimizing the number of options and actions available to the user and ensuring that those options and actions are clear and wellorganized Another important principle is consistency The interface should be consistent in terms of layout terminology and functionality so that the user can easily navigate through the system and understand how to use it Finally designers must always keep the user in mind when designing the interface The interface should be designed to meet the needs of the user rather than the preferences of the designer or the requirements of the system This means conducting user research testing and iterating on the design until it meets the needs and expectations of the user In conclusion the interface is the system and as such it plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience To design a great interface designers must approach the task with the same level of care and attention as they would any other aspect of the system They must focus on simplicity consistency and usercentered design and be willing to conduct research testing and iteration to ensure that the interface meets the needs and expectations of the user By doing so they can create interfaces that are not only functional but also intuitive userfriendly and enjoyable to use Nature figured it out a long time ago Trial and error Feedback and change Adaptation This is how humans learn This is the only way humans learn All of life has to do with improving the try to gain more valuable feedback from the error When you are designing youre trying and erroring at all points The feedback loop is constant and multilayered Processing the feedback into the next try is what gives importance to processes the how An unfortunate truth is that given the nature of complexity success is never guaranteed Process leads to product easier but process is not perfect Consider a shift instead from improving processes to improving inputs You have to put constraints on your feedback It is highly beneficial to you when your learnings are pointed in a meaningful direction Thats a lot of what design is You want to control the variables to produce the outcome What you accept in as feedback is as important as what you leave out There is as much space between trial and error as there is between error and trial Improve the try by improving the input from the error Said in a more simple manner

necessary As if there is ever something about another person that needs fixing Why triggers a defensive reaction Why is a weapon of shame guilt and exclusion more than it is a tool for exploration Understanding intent can be beneficial but using Why to get there is the physical equivalent of beating it out of someone What youre likely to get with Why are obfuscated rationales secondhand truths or flat out hostility When you ask Why of a system youre seeking causation You want to know the factors which came together to produce the current state of the system The popular 5 Whys approach seeks a root cause as if a system can have a root No system is so simple as to be able to trace an outcome to one point Systems are chains of causation impacted by variables too numerous to comprehend Asking 5 Whys in a row only gets you five answers loosely linked by virtue of the chronology of your responses Chances are high those answers have mistakenly created a chain of causation that doesnt

through art school design school or any liberal arts focused education program in the United States youre likely familiar with critique Criticism is something that is tough to swallow It has a high negative value in most situations and most people tend to avoid it The popular saying if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all is a cultural response to the tendency of people to criticize others Criticism is human nature though and youll receive a lot of it in your life Rather than avoid criticism the schools mentioned before train you emthroughem criticism For many people this is the civilian equivalent of military hell week only you get two to five years of it instead of seven days The toil is that you have to offer up your work and ask is it good enough You are forced to receive negative input about the shortcomings of your work You cant escape critique You survive it The sting of criticism doesnt leave What eventually happens is a schism between you and your work You become detached divorced desensitized to what youve created You still value what youve done but now youve learned its not about you The reward is that you get to offer up your work and ask is it good enough Will you act Will you trust Will you understand and believe You get to bring people along with you You get to create for others You get to listen and care about the concerns of

considered as the opposite of risk Give people certainty and you will have built trust Certainty is obtained primarily through the absence of falsity assertions that dont hold If you say something it

away certainty is a possible tactic You are certain you are going to stay the way you are until you choose to change Do nothing and that will remain certain Act differently and you reduce the certainty Explain how their current way is actually reducing certainty and your new way is increasing it You can induce certainty by demonstrating an understanding Colloquially known as walking a mile in someone elses shoes Perhaps the most important certainties to establish in any human interaction are the certainty that you will not harm each other and that you are acting with the others

elevate originators Well we call people originators only when they are original to us The truth behind their originality becomes meaningless when they become original to a culture or society At any

originality is through error Mistakes are wholly original and unique to the human experience It still is that pen marks on paper cannot be unmade But humans dont like mistakes You can call them happy

that involves a multitude of skills including creativity strategy and execution To deliver highquality designs you need a team of talented and experienced professionals who can collaborate and work efficiently However even the most experienced teams face challenges and its essential to develop strategies to overcome them Hire Senior Craftspeople One of the most important things that Dylan emphasizes is hiring senior folks who spike in craft Many teams tend to expect senior folks to focus more on strategy but Figma loves to have senior craftspeople on the team too They play a crucial role in mentoring pairing and giving craft feedback to the rest of the team When you have experienced designers who are passionate about their craft they can guide and inspire others to achieve their full potential Create a Culture of Riffing At Figma they do a thing called riffing a lot Its where folks share their design files and people pop in to create different iterations of things visually Its a great way to provide feedback thats more visual than written It also encourages designers to be open to feedback and to embrace the idea that their work isnt precious By having a culture of riffing you create a safe space for designers to share their work and explore new ideas Encourage Constant Focus on Craft Focusing on the craft is essential to creating highquality designs At Figma they talk a lot about the craft and encourage their team to give visual and interaction feedback Even early in the process they dont shy away from providing feedback Dylan makes a point of giving folks craft feedback himself and explains the rationale behind why it matters He emphasizes that visual decisions help achieve the goals of the project or make things easier for users By focusing on the craft you can elevate the quality of your designs and ensure that your team is constantly improving Facilitate Riffing If you want to encourage your team to riff there are some simple rituals or guidelines you can follow Start by creating a culture of trust where everyone feels comfortable sharing their work Encourage team members to share their design files and provide a link to riff on During crits designate a Riff Zone in the files so that people can go in and riff on ideas When asking for feedback on Slack include a bit that says Heres the link if you want to riff By facilitating riffing you can create a collaborative culture that promotes innovation and creativity Conclusion Building a highperforming design team is challenging but its achievable if you focus on the right things By hiring senior craftspeople creating a culture of riffing and encouraging a constant focus on craft you can increase the quality of your teams output These tips have worked for Figma and they can work for your team too By implementing these strategies you can create a team that is passionate collaborative and dedicated to creating highquality designs emSVA programming  is the equality

distinction is with dress A visual distinction immediately creates separation Naming is a challenge and is not alone sufficient enough to distinguish the AI My take is to go with the brand name not some person name Dehumanizing deplorable in all manners instances and occurrences aimed at another person is an active necessity with AI The second challenge is presenting how to use the AI to get where you are going Wayfinding is an ecological perspective transplanted onto a digital environment Where am I trying to go and how do I get there are basic questions which guide our lives and are beneficial to architect your software around Suggestions mad libs and templates address the bulk of the wayfinding challenge Nudges offer up a chance to engage with the AI The text prompt is not the ideal interface but it does have its benefits The challenge of the prompt remains the challenge of a blank slate The third challenge is one of benefit Beneficial interaction patterns to aid an AIs utility are auto filling mass data cells the suggestion enhanced text prompt collaging from existing sources and providing synthesis structures One way to get an output from AI is to remix and blend an existing one Remixing blends well with collage Essentially you are exposing someone to a prefilled template and left to figure it our rather than exposing then to a blank slate This person gets it The fourth UX challenge of AI is tuning the model whether to decrease your sigmas of deviation or personalize the AI to your brand voice or personality Allowing for immediate controls to the AI output like parameters filters weighting negative prompting sliders widgets et al benefit the user with their editing operations Allowing for long term changes requires a feedback cycle The feedback cycle is how you address drift Using edge cases as special input into your feedback cycle is a pro level play These models are like characters in a game You need a breakdown of their stats to determine the best model for the task Create a character sheet for each model benefits deterrents excellences failures most successful with blankem and for emblankem The final challenge of UX for AI is trust Caveats point to transparency expectations and confronting reality Controls like stopping starting and continuing actions keep the user in the pilot seat Footprints keep the AI credible through citations and provenance of statements Feedback can help impart ownership of the AI onto the user The key trust aspect of feedback is accountability Prove the model gets better at what does works and where necessary good at what doesnt work Data privacy is a consideration and transparent access to it for the user is needed Press releases and outreach 68 week upfront Give influencers and bloggers early access Brief analysts Leak information on social media Create announcements constantly Enlist channel partners and distributors Offer free trials Create indepth usage videos Make howitwasmade videos Give discounts Start a referral program marketing Roger Barker psychologist Ecological psychology 1968 httpsyoutubek4fKBquRis These words express a truth of most any change interpreted here as a product gift or offering abstracted though to its ultimate Saiyen in change This highly probable reality of not asking for something from you and not benefitting from what youve provided is best acknowledged as to allow the reasoned among the crowd to make their decisions We want our approach to be positive and only give people what they asked for and what they might benefit from but thats often not the position we can start from To ensure this scenario doesnt occur its best to come with proof that someone did indeed ask for what youve provided and therefore will benefit from it Sometimes though what you benefit most from is not what you asked for and it takes heart and moxie to give to someone what they did not ask for with the promise they will benefit from it Generative AI

yourself from the confines of design By nature design is a preemptive act Design is what you do before you act In a small twist design is also the history of what you have done Though that is of no concern for now It seems to me there exists a tendency to conflate creation and design I believe this is due to the proliferation of the idea of a design process Of any process really Processes are moments of action sequentially linked by time You cant design and act simultaneously Because action is placed under the banner of the design process we consider them one and the same You arent designing a work of art if you are putting paint to canvas you are creating Does that mean design cant have a process Is the act of designing defined as the process of creating a design or is it something else entirely Practically it doesnt matter Only the highmind concerns itself with such distinctions Which I think is precisely the point Somewhere along the way we need to concern ourselves less with design and more with what were making By all means go forth and design but someday I expect you to quit and start making instead emSVA Being that the promise of design is success it only makes sense that it can be pointed at you and your future Designing your life and your work life are popular topics in modern culture Something either happens by design or by accident and you dont want your future self to happen by accident I think thats all nonsense Design helps you achieve success but cannot guarantee it What happens next is unknown That isnt to say that you cant design your future self I am saying though that you need to be a little squiffy with what it means to design at that point When dealing with timelines that are a generation long the only design you can provide is one that evolves Design becomes the verb not the noun When designing your future self youre continually designing Which is what most people call living We dont unintentionally become who we are We cant Every action by a human is intentional It cannot be any other way Youre constantly designing your future self one moment at a time Heres how you get better at it  Interview someone from the oldest generation you have access to note relevant and irrelevant wisdoms the past is not guaranteed to carry the future not everything will be applicable  Set up milestones around qualities you wish to possess not achievements you wish to be known for  Write your milestones at least once a month  Understand values  Form a group with people from generations younger and older than you change it as generations are born and die  Reflect with them on the qualities you possess  Seek advice for changing  Join a similar group for someone else emSVA Loose systems encourage appropriation or at least

initiative he undertook It begins with him bedridden and bored Bertrand Russell teaches us interestingly enough the same thinking I had Boredom is a catalyst It is an activator There is real human value in anything which helps you stave off boredom Human beings show their superiority to the brutes by their capacity for boredom though I have sometimes thought in examining the apes at the zoo that they perhaps have the rudiments of this tiresome emotion However that may be experience shows that escape from boredom is one of the really powerful desires of almost all human beings Bertrand Russell 1950 If your aspirations outpace your capacity to achieve it may be because youre not bored enough to do anything about it emSVA To begin you need the capacity to run your AI If you dont own the equipment or if you want to do this at scale youll need to rent the capacity A cheap though not free yet quality option is RunPod A free yet public and not commercially viable option is Kaggle Youre renting GPU space If you want to work locally youll need a computer with a highend graphics processing unit NVIDIA is the leader in this space and most likely will remain so for a while These GPUs or graphics processing units can work fast and are the only thing capable of handling the immense number of calculations AIs need to run at speed The idea is to leverage the innate power of a GPU so the CPU doesnt have to jump in Your CPU can run a model but youll get a result back in days rather than minutes and you wont be doing anything else on the computer while it is processing RTX A4000 16GB VRAM 6 virtual CPUs 23GB System RAM 40GB ROM In both these instances you are creating a new notebook whatever exactly that means A notebook seems like an instance of some software setup These are Python 3 Youll want to go line by line and understand why numpy and pandas are helpful You can learn most of what you need to know about the Stable Diffusion or any model through Kaggles model cards or their GitHub repos Youll need to give your phone number to Kaggle to run on their GPUs It doesnt look like Runpod asks for your phone number Once youve uploaded the sample notebook you can see the code required to run stable diffusion You can execute the code blocks one by one to see what each does or run them all at once The process of running through the code takes about 10 minutes on Kaggle and 5 minutes on RunPod You need to turn the notebook off so someone else can use it when youre done Ollama can help you run an LLM locally httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvk4ReYshcA08 Cost of hosting Llama is not less than ChatGPT LoRA is a method to fine tune weights from CLIP and Unet Models are trained on image sizes Image sizes like 512x512 Any image size outsized of the size the model was trained on will produce unexpected results Reproducing the same image means using the same seed Use latent noise when adding an object not in the image Start from the CHAOS Kafka would be proud Denoising strength gives more or less weight to the prompt over the image content A low denoising strength favors the image over the prompt To overcome this you need low barriers and a high perceived present

profers a solution of conversational interactions using shared semantics httpsmagrawalasubstackcompunpredictableblackboxesareterrible Im relieved to find someone other than myself who I can agree with on this matter His language and interpretation are his and as such are not the way I would put it though in aggregate weve arrived at the same destination To understand what I mean these two assumptions need to be considered true There is no future There is only now Designs promise is an idealized future Design is useless right now Design can only be meaningful right now if right now was created by a design Youre probably thinking Im off my rocker You say design isnt useless Design is or at least can be considered the only way forward But design is a historical artifact It deals exclusively with a moment when whatever was designed did not exist Design is the precedent It is the foundation Obviously Im wrong This is all highminded nonsense from someone who has too much time to think about existential crises like the nonexistence of the future Pragmatically actions have consequences Designs lead to future outcomes Were here and our world is the way it is because of design There is a tension though You have to start from where you are to get to where you want to be emSVA I get that whatever youre doing is important It is so important that getting it wrong is not an option You might fail but you wont give up until your design succeeds Thats a lot of pressure Even if it isnt it still is You probably think about your design in the quiet moments of your life This isnt a bad thing but the weight of responsibility only grows The more youre aware the more youre pressuring yourself to do better be better succeed dont fail die rich and happy Im not saying to let all that go Imagine for a moment that your design isnt important enough to think about in the quiet moments That your design doesnt matter That what youre doing is worth doing simply because you enjoy doing it not because of what youll create Designing something that is fun and playful can be a serious affair What requires effort has value and value is something to take seriously Breathe and let it go Let the serious facade recede Let the preposterous center shine Release the jester Entertain the court Crack a joke Make it inappropriate Design something absurd You might find this notion nonsensical but there is more real estate in the absurd than in the serious Dont constrain yourself by taking yourself too seriously emSVA ux ai ux ai Articulation Barrier Users often struggle with

important concept to human development Meaning is significance to your situation right here right now Information carries no meaning Our brains construct meaning In that sense meaning is the way the brain slots the information into its internal library If something has no meaning it is ignored and forgotten Definitions propose a starting point for meaning but really a definition is information Meaning needs an emotional component perhaps more so than an intellectual one If you dont attach positive emotions to the idea of design it has no meaning What then can design mean Design can mean

Considering failure and provide a way forward The main challenge of AI is how to translate subjective human needs values and experiences into algorithmic parameters the model can optimize for As a provocation consider that the best way to wreck your opposition is to help them If all your opposition wants to do is burn the world down it may seem strange but show up with a can of gasoline and some matches This is not a tactic of subversion or espionage This is an attempt to understand how your opposers gains benefit from others In the process you will gain some practical empathy Empathy is always valuable emSVA We have an obligation to do work that moves us forward in significant meaningful and humanitarian ways What you make matters Money is easy integrity is hard You can think of the brain as a biological device consisting of three layers From oldest to newest they go motor emotional intellectual From control they go motor emotional intellectual Its a fact there are certain motor actions you cannot deprogram Touch a hot stove and dont pull your hand back Just sayin What we can do with this information is design for each layer Designing for the motor layer involved understanding the biomechanics of the body Knees dont bend backwards There are other truths about the way the human body is mechanically engineered that can be useful when designing but you really need to spend time to understand the motor capabilities of your audience Were all built the same way but were not all capable of the same things Olympic athletes require a different design than couch warriors Designing for the intellectual layer seems difficult and is perhaps the most frightening of the layers to explore but its not overly complicated It is true that the intellect is one area where humans diverge the widest Our experiences make us into different intellectual beings How I interpret the world may be different than how you interpret the world Explore context culture and history and youll have solid ground to start your designs on The emotional layer is the trickiest because it is the layer with the largest influence Your intellect changes based on your emotional state It is possible that in certain emotional states new areas of your motor ability are activated The stories of mothers moving cars off their trapped children tell us that humans are capable of more than we generally allow ourselves to be capable of However for the vast majority of us those cases are rare It is generally supposed that emotions impact our intellectual capabilities much more readily than our physical Designing for emotions involves understanding what has to be true for someone to shift states or true for them not to shift states You seek comfort at least as much as you avoid discomfort Shifting out of negative states requires a release The negativity has to be confronted and worked through Fear dissipates when the fear is labeled and processed The same goes for sadness grief melancholy and the many other shades of depression we experience Designing for happiness means giving a feeling of forward motion satiation and control Follow the rules of your brain and design for the physical first emotional second and intellectual third emSVA Some ideas are unequivocally bad ideas Some ideas sound bad but are good ideas Some ideas we call bad because were afraid of them but they are actually good ideas Some ideas are obviously good ideas The notion of constructive dialogue is beneficial but is a wholly insufficient means of creation Yes and establishes the past as the truth Thats the yes part I accept what you said It is now part of reality And is what Im doing with that information The subtext is that and does not reverse yes The truth is set move on Piling onto the past helps everyone feel included in the creation process It does not inherently produce a desirable creation A common wisdom is that great writing is rewriting A common phrase illustrating this point is I could have written a shorter speech if I had more time Creation and curation Variation and selection Exploration and evaluation Writing and editing The creation part is only half the process Yes and is creation not curation The complement is critical reflection You need to take a step back from whatever you yes anded into existence and assess its value and merit Make note of the great ideas the serendipitous synergies and the moments of unexpected pleasure Make note of the bad ideas Dont turn a good idea into a bad idea Realize though that creation produces more failures than successes Youre stripping what you made down to the irreducible core This core is now the new truth the new yes that you and onto I get that in a world of abundant criticism and denigration we need a tool of inclusion and positivity Understand though that in a world of inclusion and positivity we also need criticism and denigration Humans and our nature are rarely singular Yin and yang need each other Yes and your idea is not a good one is a perfectly valid way to create SVAp
